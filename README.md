# Smart-Trolley-with-Automated-Billing-System
# Problem Statement:
  In today's fast-paced retail environment, efficiency at the checkout counter is paramount for 
both customers and retailers. The conventional process of manually scanning each item at the 
checkout can lead to long queues, resulting in customer frustration and lost sales opportunities. To 
address this challenge, this project presents a Smart Trolley with an Automated Billing System 
designed to streamline the shopping experience in hypermarkets. 

# Introduction:
 The Smart Trolley integrates cutting-edge technologies such as Radio-Frequency 
 Identification (RFID) and Internet of Things (IoT) components to automate the billing process. At 
the heart of the system lies a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, responsible for orchestrating the 
seamless interaction between various hardware components. The EM-18 RFID reader embedded in 
the trolley enables the automatic scanning of RFID-tagged items. As customers place products in 
the trolley, their RFID-tagged items are automatically scanned, updating the bill displayed on an 
LCD screen integrated into the trolley. The interface provides a clear breakdown of items and their 
corresponding prices, ensuring transparency and ease of understanding for customers. Upon 
completion of shopping, customers can seamlessly pay the generated bill using a scanner 
conveniently placed on the trolley. Security measures are implemented to safeguard customer data 
and ensure the integrity of transactions.  
          The system's scalability and integration potential with various payment methods enhance its 
applicability in diverse retail environments. This innovative solution not only streamlines the 
checkout process but also enhances the overall shopping experience, fostering customer satisfaction 
and operational efficiency in hypermarkets. As retailers strive to differentiate themselves in a 
competitive market landscape, the Smart Trolley stands out as a transformative solution that delivers 
tangible value to both businesses and consumers alike.
